CY P03 24 02 - Care within the home

We aim to explore data related to care delivered within the home settings and gain a better understanding and improve patient safety in this setting. Our goals include exploring what providing care in the home involves and the associated patient safety events/risks. We aim to generate new insights into underexplored health inequalities that exist within the home care setting and their impact on patient safety. We aim to inform our work by conducting a scoping exercise of the existing literature, whilst taking into account the opportunities provided by the cBradford database, to gain new insights into care provided in the home and the associated patient safety implications.
